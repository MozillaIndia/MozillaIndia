MozillaIndia
============

This is the source code for the static landing page of MozillaIndia.org. The website is built using the sandstone theme extracted from Mozilla's Bedrock project.

Downloading feed from MozillaIndia Blog
=======================================

Download a copy of MozillaIndia Blog and save the xml to `feeds/feeds.xml`. On
page load, this file is used to load the feeds. Here is a cURL example of doing this:

```
$ curl http://blog.mozillaindia.org/feed/ --create-dirs -o feeds/feeds.xml
```

The `feeds/feeds.xml` file is ignored by Git and will not be added to the repository.

CSS

- CSS is written in Less and is kept in the `less` directory.
- `less/styles.less` organizes CSS files together. Any new Less file is imported into `less/styles.less` and compiled to `css/styles.css`.
- Any third party CSS go to the `css` directory.
- MozillaIndia-specific CSS goes in `less/mozin/mozin.less`.

HTML
----

- Edit `index.html` for adding/editing any content.
