You can help by finding out problems on the website (QA), sending suggestions, and/or coding.

## Reporting problems or suggestions

Go through [the issues](https://github.com/MozillaIndia/mozillaindia.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and create a new issue if yours is not already added.

## Adding code

### Setting up developer tools

The website is built using [Gatsby](https://gatsby.org). To set up a local workspace, here is what you should do.

1. Fork and clone the repo as described in git workflow below
2. Make sure that you have latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.
3. Install `gatsby-cli` globally using

```
npm i -g gatsby-cli
```

(To know more how to install `gatsby-cli` refer the official Gatsby [Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/))

([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) might work as well, not recommended in order to avoid conflict with yarn.lock)

4. In the project repository install all the packages using `yarn install`
5. Run `gatsby develop` to run the server. By default the server runs at `localhost:8000`


### Git workflow

- Fork this repo using the button at the top.
- Clone your forked repo locally.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:yourname/mozillaindia.github.io.git
```

- Don't modify or work on the master branch, we'll use it to always be in sync with the upstream.

```
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:MozillaIndia/mozillaindia.github.io.git
$ git fetch upstream
```

- If you're working on something that doesn't have an issue related to it, create an issue.
- Comment on the related issue that you're working on it.
- Once you're clear to go, go to your local copy and create a new branch to work on it. Use a descriptive name for it, include the issue number for reference.

`$ git checkout -b add-contribution-guidelines-68`

- Do your coding and push it to your fork.
  - Use spacing and code style that is consistent with the rest of the file.
  - Include as few commits as possible (one should be enough) and a good description. ([Read this about writing good commit messages](http://365git.tumblr.com/post/3308646748/writing-git-commit-messages)). Include a reference to the issue with "Fix #number".

```
$ git commit -m "Add contribution guidelines. Fix #68"
$ git push origin add-contribution-guidelines-68
```

- Do a new pull request from your "add-contribution-guidelines-68" branch to MozillaIndia/mozillaindia.github.io "master".

#### How to implement changes suggested on a pull request

Sometimes when you submit a PR, you will be asked to correct some code. You can make the changes on your work branch and commit normally and the PR will be automatically updated.

`$ git commit -am "Ops, fixing typo"`

Once everything is OK, you will be asked to merge all commit messages into one to keep history clean.

`$ git rebase -i master`

Edit the file and mark as fixup (f) all commits you want to merge with the first one:

```
pick 0343e07 Add contribution guidelines. Fix #68
f b435a67 Ops, fixing typo
```

Once rebased you can force a push to your fork branch and the PR will be automatically updated.

`$ git push origin add-contribution-guidelines-68 --force`

#### How to keep your local branches updated

To keep your local master branch updated with upstream, regularly do:

```
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout master
$ git pull --rebase upstream master
```

To update the branch you are coding in:

```
$ git checkout add-contribution-guidelines-68
$ git rebase master
```

## Adding Communities

To add community make sure you have the correct name, and social media details such as Telegram Group Link, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, GitHub and the communities. (It is not necessary to have be present on every platform. It would be easy for the users to get easily directed to the community if the links are provided.)

### Regional Groups

To add Regional Goups on the website, add the details in `data/regionalgroups.json`

### Functional Groups

To add Functional Goups on the website, add the details in `data/functionalgroups.json`

### Campus Clubs

To add Campus Clubs on the website, add the details in `data/campusclubs.json`
